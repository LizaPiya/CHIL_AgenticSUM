Initial ultrasound revealed a large pancreatic head mass highly suspicious for advanced pancreatic cancer with metastatic spread to the liver and lymph nodes. He was urgently admitted to the ICU for sepsis and obstructive cholangitis.
During hospitalization, ERCP revealed a large pancreatic tumor obstructing the common bile duct, and multiple gallstones were extracted. A biliary stent was placed, and pathology later confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma. EUS-guided biopsy showed malignant cells with vascular invasion. CT imaging further demonstrated rapid expansion of his abdominal aortic aneurysm to over 6.5 cm, requiring emergent endovascular repair during this admission.
Post-procedure, the patient developed acute pancreatitis complicated by respiratory failure, requiring brief intubation. His liver enzymes initially worsened but later normalized after chemotherapy was initiated inpatient. He was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and started on insulin for newly diagnosed diabetes.","Mr. ___ is a man with significant cardiovascular disease, chronic pancreatitis, hypertension, alcohol use disorder, and known abdominal aortic aneurysm who presented with painless jaundice. Initial right upper quadrant ultrasound showed biliary ductal dilation and a hypoechoic area near the pancreatic head, raising concern for biliary obstruction and possible malignancy.
He was admitted for further evaluation with ERCP and EUS. ERCP demonstrated a 2 cm common bile duct stricture without stones or a visible mass. A biliary stent was placed, and sphincterotomy was performed. EUS showed changes consistent with chronic pancreatitis, including pancreatic stranding and ductal cutoff at the pancreatic head, but no discrete mass. Biopsies and brushings were obtained, with results pending at discharge.
CT pancreas protocol imaging similarly did not reveal a definitive pancreatic mass, though a small area of ductal transition remained indeterminate. Following stent placement, his liver enzymes improved, abdominal pain was mild and transient, and he tolerated a regular diet prior to discharge.
His known abdominal aortic aneurysm was evaluated by vascular surgery and found to be stable on CTA, requiring no acute intervention. Other issues during admission included mild hyponatremia, which resolved with fluids, and anemia likely related to hemodilution.
He was discharged in stable condition with plans for repeat ERCP for stent removal, outpatient vascular follow-up, and monitoring of pending pathology results."

Initial imaging revealed massive bilateral pulmonary emboli and severe right heart strain requiring emergent thrombolysis.
Cardiac evaluation showed complete heart block and recurrent ventricular tachycardia necessitating temporary pacing.
She underwent urgent coronary angiography, which demonstrated triple-vessel disease requiring balloon angioplasty.
Her hospital course was complicated by acute liver failure, renal failure requiring dialysis, and septic shock.
An echocardiogram revealed a ruptured papillary muscle with severe mitral regurgitation and a ventricular septal defect.
Despite aggressive ICU management, she required prolonged mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support.
She was ultimately discharged to a long-term care facility with hospice consultation and a poor overall prognosis.","The patient, with limited prior medical history, presented with progressive dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea three weeks after a viral upper respiratory infection. Initial evaluation revealed severe volume overload with a markedly elevated BNP of 6915, cardiomegaly with pulmonary vascular congestion, and small bilateral pleural effusions on chest imaging. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated new severe systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15% and global ventricular dysfunction, representing a significant decline from a prior study showing preserved function. She was treated with intravenous furosemide and successfully diuresed to a dry weight of 80.2 kg, with improvement in her symptoms. A contrast-enhanced echocardiogram subsequently identified a large apical left ventricular thrombus, and anticoagulation was initiated with enoxaparin bridging to warfarin. Given the presence of the thrombus, invasive coronary angiography was deferred, with plans for outpatient evaluation including cardiac MRI and eventual coronary assessment. She was started on guideline-directed medical therapy with metoprolol succinate and lisinopril, which were well tolerated, and discharged on a stable diuretic regimen along with a wearable defibrillator after discussion with her family. At discharge, she was euvolemic, hemodynamically stable, and had close follow-up arranged for anticoagulation monitoring and heart failure management."

Followup Instructions: ___","The patient is a middle-aged man with relapsed AML status post stem cell transplant complicated by severe graft failure, end-stage liver disease, and recurrent septic shock, admitted emergently for worsening respiratory failure during dialysis. He received high-dose IVIG for acute immunologic collapse and was treated for presumed fungal pneumonia with amphotericin. His GVHD had progressed to involve the brain and kidneys, prompting escalation of ruxolitinib to daily dosing. He developed recurrent MRSA bacteremia requiring prolonged IV vancomycin and removal of all central lines. Dialysis was complicated by hypotension and cardiac arrest, though he ultimately stabilized. He was discharged on hospice with plans for comfort-focused care and no further chemotherapy.","The patient is a ___-year-old individual with a history of acute myeloid leukemia status post unrelated allogeneic stem cell transplant complicated by chronic graft-versus-host disease, hypogammaglobulinemia, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, who was admitted for a scheduled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion coordinated with dialysis. The patient requires monthly IVIG, and a 25-gram dose was administered during this admission without complication.The patient remains in remission from AML and continues treatment for chronic GVHD with ruxolitinib, which was increased to 20 mg three times weekly after dialysis. Home prophylactic medications, including antiviral and antipneumocystis prophylaxis, were continued, as was daily prednisone. The patient has a history of Staphylococcus bacteremia previously treated with intravenous vancomycin; IV therapy was completed, and the patient was transitioned to oral minocycline for suppression per infectious disease recommendations. Vancomycin locks for the port and dialysis catheter were continued pending outpatient reassessment. The patient underwent scheduled hemodialysis during admission and remained clinically stable without evidence of volume overload or hypoxia. Chronic pulmonary GVHD remained stable on home BiPAP and inhaled therapies. Pain, anticoagulation for prior pulmonary embolism, heart failure medications, nutritional support, and chronic psychiatric medications were continued. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with close outpatient follow-up arranged."

Though initial ultrasounds of your leg did not show blood clots in the lower leg, a CT scan of your pelvis revealed a 2-cm clot in your external iliac vein. You may have a higher tendency to form clots given your history of cancer and radiation to your bladder. We started you on a blood thinning medication called Coumadin (Warfarin) which you will continue for 6 months. Your INR level is a measure of how well your blood is being thinned and your goal level is ___. You will need to have this checked frequently and your dose adjusted accordingly. Until you INR level is therapeutic, you should continue to take Lovenox injections twice daily as you have been doing in the hospital. You will have your bloodwork checked on ___. You will follow with your PCP and Dr. ___ at the dates/times below. We have made the following changes to your medications: - Take Lovenox injections (110mg) at 8am and 8pm every day until your INR is ___ - Take Coumadin 10mg daily and get your INR level measured frequently - Continue the rest of your home medications","Pt is ___ yo M with hx of of prior silent MI, HTN, HLD, transitional cell carcinoma (s/p radiation, no surgery or chemo) who p/w LLE edema and swelling . # DVT: Given the patient's history of bladder cancer and radiation within the past year, his LLE edema was most consistent on presentation with lymphatic obstruction, either from reseeding of the lymphatic bed with tumor or direct damage from radiation. However, the patient's pain on hip flexion, tenderness in the left hip, and acute onset suggested DVT. LENIs were negative, suggesting a more proximal DVT. He was started on a heparin drip on admission. CT abd/pelvis the following day demonstrated a 2cm DVT in the left external iliac vein. The patient's heparin drip was continued, and he was started on 5mg coumadin. His INR remained subtherapeutic, and his coumadin was increased to 10mg. The patient initially refused to go home on Lovenox injections on account of his fear of needles but after several attempts at counseling, he agreed to administer his own Lovenox with the assistance of a home ___ until his INR became therapeutic. He was discharged with 110mg BID Lovenox injections, 10mg coumadin qdaily, and scheduled to follow-up with his PCP to manage his anticoagulation over the next 6 months. He should follow-up with oncology or his PCP regarding how long to continue on anticoagulation given that inciting cause of DVT was either malignancy or XRT and it is unclear whether the provoking agent can ever be considered removed. . # Acute renal insufficiency: The patient's baseline Cr is 1.2 and was 1.3 on admission. Per the patient, he has been dehydrated the previous 2 days. His Cr remained at baseline after adequate IVF rehydration and was 1.2 upon discharge. . # Bladder CA - In-house CT abd/pelvis showed no evidence of recurrence or metastatic spread of patient's previous bladder cancer. The patient was scheduled for routine surveillance CT in ___, and we have communicated with his radiation oncologist in order to cancel this study, if the in-house CT performed during this hospitalization is sufficient to rule out recurrence. . # HTN - The patient's blood pressure was well-controlled throughout his hospitalization on his home anti-hypertensives. . # Hyperlipidemia - The patient was continued on his home statin. . # S/p silent MI - Given the patient's history of silent MI, we have communicated with the patient's PCP regarding aspirin and ACE inhibitor therapy. He will follow-up with his PCP for further management of this condition. .","Patient admitted for evaluation of numbness in the lower extremities.

- No other area of venous clot is noted 
- No evidence of pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy 
- No pelvic free fluid 
- No evidence of deep vein thrombosis syndrome 
- No evidence of bladder cancer or effects of x-ray therapy 
- No","The patient is a ___-year-old man with a history of prior silent myocardial infarction, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder status post radiation therapy, who presented with left lower extremity swelling and edema.
Given his recent cancer history and radiation exposure, lymphatic obstruction was initially considered, but the acute onset of pain, hip tenderness, and swelling raised concern for deep vein thrombosis.
Initial lower extremity Doppler studies were negative, suggesting a more proximal clot, and he was started on a heparin infusion on admission.
A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis subsequently revealed a 2 cm thrombus in the left external iliac vein.
Heparin was continued, and warfarin was initiated with dose escalation due to a persistently subtherapeutic INR.
Although he initially declined outpatient injections, the patient ultimately agreed to self-administer enoxaparin with home assistance until his INR becomes therapeutic.
He was discharged on enoxaparin 110 mg twice daily and warfarin 10 mg daily, with close follow-up arranged with his primary care physician to manage anticoagulation over the next six months.
His renal function remained stable throughout hospitalization, returning to baseline after intravenous fluid rehydration.
CT imaging showed no evidence of recurrent or metastatic bladder cancer, and coordination with his radiation oncologist was initiated regarding future surveillance imaging.
His blood pressure and lipid levels remained well controlled on home medications, and follow-up with his primary care physician was planned to address secondary prevention related to his prior silent myocardial infarction."

For a full detailed history of the patient's lung cancer, please see ___ note from ___. In brief, most recently in ___, the patient had a CT chest which showed a 1.3 x 1.0 cm right lower lobe lung nodule, increased from 1.0 x 0.4 cm, thought to be most likely bronchogenic carcinoma. On ___ the patient had a CT guided RFA of this lesion. The procedure was complicated by a small amount of hemorrhage, and a small pneumothorax, so a biopsy of the lesion was not obtained. Ms. ___ was admitted to ___ from ___ to ___ with respiratory failure after the RFA. She was treated with Levaquin for pneumonia. Her oxygenation improved and she was discharged to ___ in ___, where she stayed for two weeks. A follow up CT with contrast on ___ showed a cavitary nodule in the medial RLL significantly increased to 3.4 x 3.7 cm compared with 2.3 cm with central low density suggesting necrosis. The nodule abutted the esophagus and posterior pericardium without definite evidence of invasion. Given the location of the patient's lesion, it was not felt to be amenable to a wedge resection, but would rather require a basal segmentectomy. However, it was also thought to be amenable to CyberKnife SBRT which would require biopsy and fiducial marker placement. On ___, she underwent outpatient biopsy & fiducial placement of RLL lung mass. 4 core biopsy samples were sent for pathology, and 10cc of purulent fluid were sent for microbiology. A CT showed a small paramediastinal pneumothorax post-procedure, with follow up CXRs at 2 and 4 hours post procedure showing resolution of the PTX. Clinically, she has been stable on room air. Upon arrival to the floor, the patient reports that her breathing is at baseline with no shortness of breath. She states that the procedure was quite painful, but that she no longer has any pain. She has no chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or other complaints, and is hopeful that she will be able to go home early tomorrow. <PAST MEDICAL HISTORY> PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: - Age-related macular degeneration - GERD - Hyperlipidemia - Prior removal of a vocal cord polyp - Hypertension - Lung cancer - Squamous cell cancer on the face - Left bundle branch block PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: - s/p squamous cell cancer removal from face - s/p vocal cord polyp removal <SOCIAL HISTORY> ___ <FAMILY HISTORY> son died of met CA, daughter healthy Physical ___: ADMISSION EXAM: -== VITALS: 97.3PO148 / 79 HR: 70RR: 20O2: 96RA GENERAL: Alert and interactive.

She reported three episodes of bleeding in the morning, sufficient to turn the toilet water red, which resolved spontaneously. She denied abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or lightheadedness at the time of bleeding. She noted a brief episode of crampy abdominal pain the prior night that resolved after a non-bloody loose bowel movement. She reported one prior self-limited episode of rectal bleeding earlier in the year. Her last colonoscopy was several years ago. On examination, she was hemodynamically stable and in no acute distress. Abdominal exam was benign. Laboratory studies showed stable hemoglobin and hematocrit without evidence of ongoing bleeding. Coagulation studies and basic metabolic panel were unremarkable. No invasive procedures were performed during this admission. She did not experience recurrent bleeding while hospitalized, and her blood counts remained stable. The lower gastrointestinal bleed was considered resolved. She was discharged home in stable condition with instructions to resume home medications, including doxycycline for presumed Lyme disease, and to contact her gastroenterologist promptly for outpatient follow-up and further evaluation. She was advised to seek medical attention if bleeding recurred or if new concerning symptoms developed.


","The patient is a ___-year-old woman with a history of colon cancer and breast cancer who presented with bright red blood per rectum.
The bleeding resolved prior to admission after she received intravenous fluids in the emergency department, and she was admitted for monitoring.
Her hematocrit was mildly decreased to 39.1 at the time of discharge, which was felt to be due to hemodilution rather than ongoing blood loss.
She remained hemodynamically stable throughout hospitalization with negative orthostatic vital signs prior to discharge.
The episode of bleeding followed straining with a large bowel movement and was painless, making a hemorrhoidal source most likely.
Other potential etiologies, including diverticulosis, arteriovenous malformations, or malignancy, were also considered given her history.
She had no further episodes of bleeding during hospitalization and remained afebrile with low suspicion for infectious causes.
Given her history of colon cancer and the interval since her last colonoscopy, outpatient gastrointestinal evaluation with full colonoscopy was recommended.
The patient reported she was already in contact with her gastroenterologist and planned to arrange follow-up promptly.
Her asthma remained stable, and she was continued on nebulizer treatments and a prednisone taper as previously prescribed.
She was advised to continue doxycycline for Lyme disease, with reassurance provided regarding her concerns about this medication.
She was discharged home in stable condition on a diet as tolerated, with no pharmacologic DVT prophylaxis given recent gastrointestinal bleeding and plans for close outpatient GI follow-up."

He received PO Dilaudid and standing tylenol for pain control during his hospital stay. On the morning of ___, his Hct was 19.4, a repeat Hct was 18.6. He was given 2u pRBCs. A post-transfusion Hct was 22. He spiked to 102.7 for which he was pan-cultred. CXR was negative for pneumonia. IV Zosyn was started for empiric coverage. Right groin puncture site pain was persistent. U/S of the area identified a 2.5 cm partially thrombosed right groin pseudoaneurysm, with a neck measuring 3 mm in width. Hct decreased to 19 again. IV Vitamin K was given for INR of 2.9. An abdominal CT was also done demonstrating just ascites. Post CT, creatinine increased to 3.9. He was bloused with IV fluid for low urine output. ___ then embolized the pseudoaneurysm on ___. Postop, embolization, right groin appeared ecchymotic with positive distal pulses. He had less pain in the right groin. Hct was down to 17. Two units of PRBC were transfused with post hct of 23. Postop transfusion, he had an 8 beat run of VTach that resolved. Calcium repletion was given for calcium of 7.5. Hct stabilized at ___. LFTs were notable of rise in t.bili to 3.9. ERCP was done on to interrogate the metal stent on ___. It was noted that the previously placed metal stent had migrated, a CBD anastomotic stricture was noted and a new MS was placed. He tolerated this procedure well and diet was advanced to regular the next day. A repeat U/S of the groin was done on ___lood flow at the neck of the pseudoaneurysm which may represent a small arterial branch vessel. No documented flow within the body of the pseudoaneurysm. He continued to have discomfort at this site as well as abdominal and back pain for which he was receiving po Dilaudid. He was taking a total of ___ per day of the Dilaudid.

In the emergency department, she was started on empiric vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir after multiple unsuccessful lumbar puncture attempts. On inpatient evaluation, her headache was improving, and she had no neck stiffness or other exam findings suggestive of meningitis. Given her report of a new severe headache and a family history of hemorrhagic stroke related to aneurysm, a non-contrast head CT was obtained and was normal, making aneurysmal rupture unlikely. A subsequent image-guided lumbar puncture revealed bland cerebrospinal fluid with minimal cells and no xanthochromia, leading to discontinuation of antibiotics and antivirals and ruling out subarachnoid hemorrhage. Additional infectious studies, including chest X-ray, urinalysis, and influenza testing, were negative, with several viral and tick-borne studies pending at discharge. Overall, her presentation was felt to be most consistent with a severe migraine triggered by a viral illness. Her symptoms were managed conservatively with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and topical lidocaine for pain at prior lumbar puncture sites, and she continued her home medications for migraine prophylaxis, mood, allergic rhinitis, nausea, and insomnia. She was discharged in stable condition with instructions to follow up pending test results and monitor for resolution of her symptoms."

She required prolonged intravenous antibiotics and multiple revision spine surgeries.
Despite aggressive intervention, she remained neurologically impaired with minimal recovery.
Goals-of-care discussions were initiated due to poor functional prognosis.
She was discharged to a long-term acute care facility with ventilator dependence and palliative follow-up.","The patient’s presenting symptoms were felt to be most consistent with neck muscle strain and spasm superimposed on chronic cervical spondylosis and degenerative disc disease. Plain radiographs of the cervical spine demonstrated normal bone density with decreased physiologic lordosis, a sharp angulation at C5–C6, fusion at C6–C7, mild dorsal spondylosis throughout the cervical spine, and minimal intervertebral arthrosis, without evidence of compression fracture or pathologic displacement. Preliminary cervical spine MRI revealed a congenital block vertebral body from C6 through T1 with partial obliteration of dorsal disc spaces, multifactorial canal narrowing without spinal cord deformity or intrinsic signal abnormality at C5–C6, bilateral neural foraminal narrowing with possible C6 nerve root impingement, and left-sided foraminal encroachment at C4–C5 likely affecting the exiting C5 nerve root. MRA of the neck was normal. Her neck pain and muscle spasm were well controlled on her outpatient medication regimen, and she was advised not to drive or consume alcohol while taking these medications. She was instructed to follow up with neurology as an outpatient. During her hospitalization, hyponatremia resolved with saline administration, and an uncomplicated cystitis was treated with a three-day course of ciprofloxacin based on preliminary urine culture results. Her chronic pain regimen was continued, blood glucose levels remained well controlled on an insulin sliding scale, and there were no acute issues related to her epilepsy while continuing carbamazepine. Her reflux esophagitis, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were managed with continuation of her home medications."

Home pravastatin was changed transiently to high dose atorvastatin while there was concern for possible ACS/NSTEMI. Metoprolol, aspirin, and IMDUR were continued. Admission EKG was unchanged from prior, serial cardiac enzymes were drawn and remained flat so heparin and nitro were discontinued. On hospital day 1, chest pain recurred while patient was lying in bed. EKG at the time showed TWIs in precordial leads. Patient was restarted on heparin gtt. He was taken for a nuclear stress on ___ that showed no reversible areas of ischemia.

Emergent coronary angiography revealed acute left main occlusion with extensive myocardial necrosis.
He underwent urgent coronary artery bypass grafting complicated by intraoperative cardiogenic shock.
Postoperatively, he developed severe systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction below 10 percent.
His hospital course was further complicated by recurrent ventricular arrhythmias requiring defibrillator placement.
Renal failure ensued, necessitating continuous dialysis and vasopressor support.
He was diagnosed with fulminant ulcerative colitis flare causing massive gastrointestinal bleeding.
Despite aggressive medical and surgical management, his condition continued to decline.
Goals-of-care discussions were held with family given poor prognosis.
He was discharged to inpatient hospice with comfort-focused care.","The patient is a ___-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease complicated by prior STEMI involving the posterolateral ventricular branch of the right coronary artery status post bare-metal stent placement, as well as ulcerative colitis, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, who presented with chest pain in the setting of a known chronically occluded right coronary artery on recent cardiac catheterization. Given concern for unstable angina, he was initially treated with heparin and nitroglycerin infusions, and his home pravastatin was temporarily switched to high-dose atorvastatin while acute coronary syndrome was being evaluated. Admission electrocardiogram was unchanged from prior studies, and serial cardiac enzymes remained negative, allowing discontinuation of heparin and nitroglycerin. On hospital day one, he experienced recurrent chest pain at rest with new T-wave inversions in the precordial leads, prompting reinitiation of heparin therapy. A subsequent nuclear stress test demonstrated no reversible ischemia. His chest pain was ultimately managed medically, and he was discharged with sublingual nitroglycerin for symptomatic relief and started on amlodipine for possible coronary vasospasm, while metoprolol was discontinued due to low systolic blood pressures and the addition of amlodipine. Evaluation for heart failure showed preserved systolic function on repeat echocardiography with an ejection fraction of 50–55 percent, and lower extremity ultrasound showed no evidence of deep vein thrombosis. He remained euvolemic on his home regimen of furosemide and lisinopril, continued tamsulosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia, and was discharged with plans for outpatient reassessment of beta-blocker therapy."

Maintained on standing allopurinol . # Macrocytic Anemia: Stable. Multiple prior B12/folates normal.","The patient is a middle-aged woman with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF ~25%), permanent atrial fibrillation, and a history of multiple prior myocardial infarctions who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure.
She was found to be in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response causing cardiogenic shock and hypotension.
CT angiography revealed massive bilateral pulmonary emboli with right ventricular strain and pulmonary infarction.
She required ICU admission, noninvasive ventilation, and intravenous vasopressor support.
Aggressive diuresis with high-dose IV furosemide and continuous bumetanide infusion led to rapid symptomatic improvement.
The heart failure exacerbation was triggered by medication noncompliance and excessive salt intake.
Her anticoagulation was transitioned from warfarin to apixaban after supratherapeutic INR-related bleeding complications.
She developed acute kidney injury requiring temporary dialysis during hospitalization.
Rheumatoid arthritis flared, necessitating escalation of steroids and biologic therapy.
She was discharged home on home oxygen with plans for heart transplant evaluation.","She is a woman with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation who came to the hospital because her breathing had slowly become more difficult.
Testing showed no infection or blood clot, but imaging and symptoms were consistent with a heart failure exacerbation.
Her heart rate remained well controlled, making atrial fibrillation an unlikely cause of her shortness of breath.
She was treated with increased diuretics, including a brief course of IV furosemide, which led to steady improvement.
Her oxygen needs resolved as excess fluid was removed, and her breathing returned close to baseline.
Spironolactone was increased to support ongoing volume control.
She remained stable on her chronic heart medications, including beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, statin, and digoxin.
Her anticoagulation was adjusted due to a high INR on admission, and warfarin was restarted at a lower dose.
Other chronic conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and osteoporosis, remained stable during admission.
She was discharged feeling improved, with instructions to monitor her weight closely and follow up with cardiology."

Pt was started on subcutaneous Insulin coverage once gap had closed, with frequent finger sticks. Potassium was repleted PRN. Differential for precipitating factors included diarrhea, gastroparesis, c.diff, MI, infection, or viral gastroenteritis (given pt's lower abdominal discomfort on admission). Pt also may have had TSS with history that a tampon was left in place for 5 days (this history was revealed on a few days after admission). Pt received a single dose of Levoquin in ED on admission, which was not continued in the ICU given that she had borderline high normal WBC and afebrile. Tachycardia resolved with hydration. Upon discovery of retained tampon during hospital stay, vancomycin was started, however, this too was discontinued based on the absence of clinical symptoms and signs. 2) Unstable angina: Pt complained of substernal chest pain in the ED. EKG changes were initially felt to be consistent with demand ischemia due to tachycardia. Pt had cardiac enzyme elevation that peaked then slowly trended down. Pt continued to have short episodes of chest tightness, and cardiac enzymes were cycled. ASA, statin (80 mg daily rather than 10 mg daily, which is her home dose), metoprolol, isosorbide dinitrate (later switched to isosorbide mononitrate extended release) were continued. Heparin gtt were used intermittently with her symptoms. Pt underwent cardiac catherization on ___, which showed diffusely diseased vessels and two out of three occluded grafts (which were previously seen in ___. No interventions were made. 3) DM, type 1 ___ followed the patient during her stay. Pt's insulin regimen were optimized according to blood sugar checks. Pt was encouraged to take part in sliding scale insulin administration. Pt was discharged home on Glyburide 5 mg daily, Lantus 18 units at dinner time, and short-acting insulin with carbohydrate counting. Pt has an appointment to follow up at ___. 4) ARF: Cr 1.7 on admission. Improved to 0.7 with aggressive hydration. U/S of transplanted kidney showed mild pelviectasis. Because pt received dye for cardiac cath, pt was instructed to get a check of BUN and Cr when she follows up with her PMD. 5) Lower abdominal tenderness: unclear etiology. UCG was neg. Resolved shortly after admission. 6) S/p renal transplant: Pt's regular immunosuppressive therapy was continued. Renal team followed pt as inpatient. Pt was advised not to miss any transplantation medications (may open capsules and take the powder sublingually if unable to tolerate PO due to nausea). Pt's Prograf levels were in the lower limits of therapeutic range when checked during hospitalization. Pt was instructed to get a repeat level at her PMD's office when she goes for her follow-up appointment. 7) Right heel ulcer She regularly sees a podiatrist as outpatient for foot care. Podiatry was consulted as inpatient, who recommended that adaptic and guaze dressing be continued, as the ulcer is healing well. 8) Depression: stable - continued cymbalta 9) Code: DNR, but do wish to be intubated if necessary. Husband ___ is her health care proxy.","The patient was admitted to the hospital due to extreme dehydration and high blood sugars.

You were admitted on ___ for a gout flare in your left knee. You were given four doses of colchicine and one dose of indomethacin in the emergency room, which greatly improved your pain. Your home dose of probenecid was increased to prevent these gout flares in the future. You were seen by physical therapy who recommended discharge to home with physical therapy services at home. Please follow up with your primary care physician in ___ week after discharge.","___ with hx gout, atrial flutter, HTN, COPD, DM2, HLD, and recent surgery for spinal stenosis presented with one day of sudden onset left knee pain due to gout flare ACTIVE ISSUES: # Left knee pain: consistent with an acute gout attack. The patient has a history of gout, with the last attack in ___. He is on probenecid for prevention. The patient was given colchicine 0.6mg tabs x4, 50mg indomethacin, and probenecid ___ in the emergency room, which greatly improved his symptoms. His probenecid was incraesed to 1000mg BID in order to prevent future attacks. He should follow up with his PCP for further management of his gout. # Diarrhea: The patient had several episodes of diarrhea after receiving 4 doses of colchicine in the emergency room. After stopping his colchicine his diarrhea improved. CHRONIC ISSUES: # Spinal stenosis: the patient was recently admitted in ___ for spinal stenosis s/p spinal surgery, with residual ___ weakness. He has been in rehab for several weeks and his ___ weakness is improving. Can walk with walker or cane at home. There was some concern initially for cauda equina syndrome given history of urinary urgency and ___ weakness, however, there was no saddle anesthesia and his weakness seemed to be improving. Rectal tone was intermediate and the patient was able to bear down. Physical therapy consulted and initially recommended going to rehab. At discharge the patient had improved and they recommended home with ___. # Urinary urgency: The patient reported a one month of urinary urgency. He often has incontinence before he can reach the bathroom. He should follow up with his PCP about this issue. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: # Knee xray: Scalloped appearance of the anterior aspect of the femoral trochlea of indeterminant etiology and chronicity and may related to mass effect from a suprapatellar mass/effusion. MR examination would provide further imaging evaluation if clinically warranted. # Anemia: The patient is anemic with MCV of 100. He is on vitamin B12 supplementation. He should follow up with his PCP for further management of this issue.","Patient was admitted to the hospital for acute gouty arthritis of the knee. Key findings included soft tissue swelling and joint effusion in the right knee, as well as radiographic evidence of chronic trochlear changes.

11976443-DS-12,"Summary: ___ yo female with coronary artery disease status post PCI, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, breast cancer status post radical mastectomy, recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade status post pericardiocentesis left-sided pleural effusion status post thoracentesis readmitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions. . #Bilateral pleural effusion (left>right): The patient presented with respiratory distress and was found to have a recurrence of her left sided pleural effusion leading to complete left lung collapse and hypoxemia, requiring intubation. Thoracic surgery inserted a chest tube on the left and a pigtail catheter on the right which both drained serosanginous fluid. The chest tube on the right was eventually pulled after it stopped draining. The insertion of the chest tube on the left was complicated by a pneumothorax, so another chest tube was inserted on the left with a pigtail catheter. The pigtail catheter eventually stopped draining and it was subsequently pulled. A talc pleurodiesis was performed and the patient's pain was controlled with Dilaudid at first and then oxycodone thereafter. Her chest tubes were removed and a chest xray confirmed full expansion of the left lung with an unchanged pleural effusion. She continued to be diuresed with Lasix, however, she developed a metabolic alkalosis with a respiratory acidosis. Diamox was added to the lasix regimen and her bicarbonate remained level. Her final chest xray shows left lower lobe atelectasis. Movement and incentive spirometry were encouraged and should be continued at rehab. The patient continues to have an oxygen requirement, likely due to her atelectasis and possibly an underlying pulmonary process. She has a scheduled pulmonology followup appointment that was made at her last hospitalization. At that time, they will perform pulmonary function testing. . While in the ICU, the patient was started on prednisone for a post-viral serositis. The prednisone was eventually discontinued after 5 days because the post-viral serositis was unlikely in this context. Analysis of the pleural fluid showed the absence of malignant cells in cytology, no bacteria/viral/acid fast bacteria on repeat cultures, and flow cytometry showed no cells concerning for lymphoma. The pleural effusions might be due to exacerbation of her diastolic heart failure, though on prior admissions, the effusion did not appear to be a transudate. Lastly, A CT of the abdomen from ___ showed a cyst in the lower abdomen. A CA125 was mildly elevated and a ___ was in the normal range. A pelvic U/S was done to further characterize the cyst and it was noted to be a simple cyst and not concerning for malignancy. . #Septic shock: The patient was initially hypotensive and the differential included septic shock vs. cardiogenic shock. A bedside echo in the ED did not find evidence of tamponade, so the patient most likely had septic shock with the source of infection being pulmonary. Her blood pressure responded to intravenous fluids boluses. She was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics vancomycin/zosyn to cover hospital acquired pneumonia and the patient improved. She completed a full course of vancomycin/zosyn for hospital acquired pneumonia and did not have any other signs of hemodynamic instability. . #Acute on chronic anemia: The patient continued to have a low hematocrit with iron=10 (L) and a slightly high ferritin. Her stools were guiaic negative. The patient might have an underlying iron deficiency anemia, though it is unclear given her high ferritin. A reticulocyte count showed an appropriate reponse to her anemia. After repeated blood draws, the patient's hematocrit steadily dropped to 21.8. On ___, she was transfused two units of blood and tolerated it well. On discharge, her hematocrit was 28.9. . #Acute renal failure: The patient presented with acute renal failure, which was likely prerenal azotemia given UNa<10. With treatment of her hypotension, the patient's renal failure trended towards her baseline around 0.6-1.0. With continued diuresis and the addition of lisinopril for BP management, the patient developed acute renal failure again. Her diuresis was held and lisinopril discontinued. Her creatinine on discharge was 1.4. . #Urinary tract infection: The patient presented with a urinary tract infection and was treated with vanco/zosyn as detailed above. She then developed yeast in her urine and her foley was removed. Two days after her Foley was removed, she had a leukocytosis without fever or dysruia. A urine culture revealed pan-senstive Pseudomonas 10,000-100,000 colonies. Treatment with Cipro was initiated and her leukocytosis trended downwards. No yeast remains in her urine. . # Anxiety and Depression- Continue trazodone and ativan as needed. The patient was noted to be anxious during the hospitalization and would consider further therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor as an outpatient. . #Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: On admission, the patient was on amiodarone, metoprolol and coumadin. Since the patient remained in a sinus arrhythmia (not in atrial fibrillation on telemetry) throughout hospitalization, it was felt the risks of Coumadin outweighed the benefits, therefore, she will not continue on Coumadin. She will continue to take aspirin, metoprolol and amiodarone for her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. . # Recurrent pericardial effusion: The pericardial effusion has also been a recurrent issue. A TTE showed an effusion without hemodynamic compromise, therefore, it was treated medically. A repeat echocardiograms showed a reduced effusion. . #H/O hyponatremia: The patient has a history of hyponatremia that has been attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone release. Her sodium remained in normal range during her time on the floors, so she will not be continued on salt tablets on discharge. In fact, she should avoid sodium since it might precipitate congestive heart failure, the possible etiology of her pleural effusions. She will have a blood draw later in the week to check her sodium. On discharge, her sodium was 133. . # Swollen right arm: The patient was noted to have a swollen right arm. She had a PICC line during the last hospitalization. An ultrasound ruled out a deep venous thrombosis. With diuresis, the swelling improved, so it was likely related to fluid overload. . # Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl . # Osteoporosis: Continue Vitamin D/Calcium . # GERD: Continue omeprazole . # Memory loss: The patient's family states that she does not have any memory loss. She came into the hospital on Donezepil and at the family's request, it was discontinued before discharge. Outpatient followup: 1. Cardiopulmonary assessment 2. Anemia workup/treatment, if any. 3. Daily weights to assess fluid retention 4. Pulmonary followup appointment for pulmonary function tests 5. laboratories: check BUN, Cr, sodium, Hct, WBC","Summary: ___ yo female with coronary artery disease status post PCI, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, breast cancer status post radical mastectomy, recent hospitalization for cardiac tamponade status post pericardiocentesis left-sided pleural effusion status post thoracentesis readmitted with hypotension, hypoxemia, and leukocytosis in the setting of recurrent pleural and pericardial effusions. . #Bilateral pleural effusion (left>right): The patient presented with respiratory distress and was found to have a recurrence of her left sided pleural effusion leading to complete left lung collapse and hypoxemia, requiring intubation.

A pelvic U/S was done to further characterize the cyst and it was noted to be a simple cyst and not concerning for malignancy. . #Septic shock: The patient was initially hypotensive and the differential included septic shock vs. cardiogenic shock. A bedside echo in the ED did not find evidence of tamponade, so the patient most likely had septic shock with the source of infection being pulmonary. Her blood pressure responded to intravenous fluids boluses. She was initially started on broad spectrum antibiotics vancomycin/zosyn to cover hospital acquired pneumonia and the patient improved. She completed a full course of vancomycin/zosyn for hospital acquired pneumonia and did not have any other signs of hemodynamic instability. . #Acute on chronic anemia: The patient continued to have a low hematocrit with iron=10 (L) and a slightly high ferritin. Her stools were guiaic negative. The patient might have an underlying iron deficiency anemia, though it is unclear given her high ferritin. A reticulocyte count showed an appropriate reponse to her anemia. After repeated blood draws, the patient's hematocrit steadily dropped to 21.8. On ___, she was transfused two units of blood and tolerated it well. On discharge, her hematocrit was 28.9. . #Acute renal failure: The patient presented with acute renal failure, which was likely prerenal azotemia given UNa<10. With treatment of her hypotension, the patient's renal failure trended towards her baseline around 0.6-1.0. With continued diuresis and the addition of lisinopril for BP management, the patient developed acute renal failure again. Her diuresis was held and lisinopril discontinued. Her creatinine on discharge was 1.4. . #Urinary tract infection: The patient presented with a urinary tract infection and was treated with vanco/zosyn as detailed above. She then developed yeast in her urine and her foley was removed. Two days after her Foley was removed, she had a leukocytosis without fever or dysruia. A urine culture revealed pan-senstive Pseudomonas 10,000-100,000 colonies. Treatment with Cipro was initiated and her leukocytosis trended downwards. No yeast remains in her urine. . # Anxiety and Depression- Continue trazodone and ativan as needed. The patient was noted to be anxious during the hospitalization and would consider further therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor as an outpatient. . #Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: On admission, the patient was on amiodarone, metoprolol and coumadin. Since the patient remained in a sinus arrhythmia (not in atrial fibrillation on telemetry) throughout hospitalization, it was felt the risks of Coumadin outweighed the benefits, therefore, she will not continue on Coumadin. She will continue to take aspirin, metoprolol and amiodarone for her paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. . # Recurrent pericardial effusion: The pericardial effusion has also been a recurrent issue. A TTE showed an effusion without hemodynamic compromise, therefore, it was treated medically. A repeat echocardiograms showed a reduced effusion. . #H/O hyponatremia: The patient has a history of hyponatremia that has been attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone release. Her sodium remained in normal range during her time on the floors, so she will not be continued on salt tablets on discharge. In fact, she should avoid sodium since it might precipitate congestive heart failure, the possible etiology of her pleural effusions. She will have a blood draw later in the week to check her sodium. On discharge, her sodium was 133. . # Swollen right arm: The patient was noted to have a swollen right arm. She had a PICC line during the last hospitalization. An ultrasound ruled out a deep venous thrombosis. With diuresis, the swelling improved, so it was likely related to fluid overload. . # Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl . # Osteoporosis: Continue Vitamin D/Calcium . # GERD: Continue omeprazole . # Memory loss: The patient's family states that she does not have any memory loss. She came into the hospital on Donezepil and at the family's request, it was discontinued before discharge. Outpatient followup: 1. Cardiopulmonary assessment 2. Anemia workup/treatment, if any. 3. Daily weights to assess fluid retention 4. Pulmonary followup appointment for pulmonary function tests 5. laboratories: check BUN, Cr, sodium, Hct, WBC","An elderly woman with severe end-stage cardiomyopathy and uncontrolled atrial fibrillation was admitted in cardiogenic shock after stopping all her heart medications and eating a high-salt diet. She was found to have massive pulmonary emboli, pneumonia, and acute kidney failure requiring ICU admission and emergent dialysis. Her hospital course was complicated by ventricular arrhythmias, stroke, and new-onset sepsis requiring intubation. She underwent urgent cardioversion, pacemaker placement, and high-dose IV vasopressors. She was discharged to a skilled nursing facility on hospice-level care with worsening heart failure.","The patient is a woman with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with preserved ejection fraction, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis who presented with shortness of breath due to a congestive heart failure exacerbation. Initial evaluation considered CHF exacerbation, pulmonary embolism, and infection; CTA showed no embolism or infiltrate but findings consistent with right-sided heart failure. Atrial fibrillation was rate controlled and not felt to be the primary contributor. She was treated with diuresis, including intravenous furosemide, with improvement in symptoms and successful weaning off supplemental oxygen. Her outpatient diuretic regimen was adjusted with an increased dose of oral furosemide and daily spironolactone, with instructions to monitor daily weights. Chronic cardiomyopathy medications were continued. She remained in atrial fibrillation with adequate rate control on metoprolol. Anticoagulation was managed by holding warfarin initially for supratherapeutic INR, then restarting at a lower dose with close outpatient INR monitoring. Other chronic conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, gout, and macrocytic anemia, remained stable on home therapies. She was discharged in improved condition with cardiology follow-up.

You also had a heart failure exacerbation and were treated with IV diuretics to decrease the fluid retention. You were then changed back to your regular oral diuretic dose. Your ICD showed that you are having recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation. We recommend pulmonary vein isolation, a surgical procedure that can prevent new episodes of atrial fibrillation. This will be done as an outpatient. We have changed the dose of your home warfarin from 7.5mg to 4mg. The rest of your medications have not been modified. Please remember to take you medication as instructed and have a diet low in salt. Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

She was found to have fulminant Clostridioides difficile colitis with toxic megacolon and bowel perforation on CT imaging. Emergency open total colectomy with splenectomy and small bowel resection was performed, complicated by massive intraoperative bleeding requiring transfusion. Postoperatively, she developed respiratory failure requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support. Her course was further complicated by ischemic stroke related to atrial fibrillation after anticoagulation was held. She developed multidrug-resistant urosepsis requiring prolonged IV carbapenem therapy. Persistent hypokalemia led to ventricular arrhythmias requiring temporary pacing. Severe malnutrition necessitated long-term TPN and PEG tube placement. She was diagnosed with new metastatic colon cancer on surgical pathology. Latent TB reactivated, requiring four-drug RIPE therapy. She experienced adrenal crisis due to chronic steroid use. Recurrent GI bleeding worsened her anemia, requiring blood transfusions despite religious objections. She became wheelchair dependent with critical illness myopathy. She was ultimately discharged to long-term acute care with tracheostomy and poor neurologic recovery.","Ms. ___ is a woman with a history of atrial fibrillation on rivaroxaban, ulcerative colitis, and latent tuberculosis who presented with weakness and diarrhea. Her diarrhea was loose and occasionally bloody, associated with abdominal pain, and attributed to a flare of ulcerative colitis. Stool studies were negative, and CT imaging showed colonic inflammation extending to the splenic flexure. Flexible sigmoidoscopy and pathology confirmed active ulcerative colitis. Due to refractory disease, she underwent a laparoscopic proctocolectomy with end ileostomy, which she tolerated without surgical complications. Postoperatively, pain was initially managed with a PCA and then transitioned to oral medications. Her diet advancement was slow due to nausea, requiring temporary NPO status and nutritional support including TPN. She developed hypokalemia related to diarrheal losses and was repleted with close monitoring. Postoperative weakness was attributed to deconditioning and poor nutritional intake. She was treated briefly for a urinary tract infection based on urinalysis findings. Anemia was managed conservatively due to refusal of blood products as a Jehovah’s Witness. Latent TB treatment with INH was discontinued after biologic therapy was no longer planned. Anticoagulation was transitioned perioperatively and planned to resume after discharge. She was discharged to a rehabilitation facility once ambulating with assistance, tolerating a regular diet, and with pain controlled on oral medications.

He was actively resuscitated in the ICU with aggressive fluid therapy. A TTE showed hypovolemia and for a low hematocrit of 23 he was given units of packed red cells on ___ post transfusion hematocrit 26. His respiratory status was tenuous likely due to fluid overload and he was given 60mg IV Lasix for pulmonary edema. On ___ he was given another 20mg IV Lasix; a deep sputum culture was obtained showing GPC and GNR and he was started on vancomycin and ceftriaxone. The antibiotics will continue for 2 weeks. He remained in the ICU for several days becoming delirious. Geriatrics was consulted and made several recommendations pertaining to his medications such as scheduling Tylenol, minimizing narcotics, and use of small doses of anti-psychotic to manage behaviors. He was eventually transferred to the regular nursing unit where later in the evening had a desaturation episode. He was also at that time noted with low urine output and was given a fluid challenge with increase in his urine output. He has a 22 Coudé catheter in placed which was inserted by Urology during his ICU stay because of problems with urinary retention. The catheter may removed at the discretion of the primary team once voiding adequately while at rehab. His oxygen saturations did improve and he is currently 97% with forehead probe on ___ liters per minute. Of note on CT imaging of his chest a small nodule was detected; it is being recommended that he have follow up CT of his chest in the next several months. He will require follow up with his primary care doctor for this as an outpatient. He was evaluated by Physical and Occupational therapy and is being recommended for acute care rehab.","The patient is a middle-aged man who fell from a skyscraper staircase during a seizure, arriving comatose and requiring immediate neurosurgical intervention. He was found to have massive intracranial hemorrhage, spinal cord transection, and bilateral femur fractures requiring emergent fixation. In the emergency department, he suffered cardiac arrest, was resuscitated twice, and required prolonged CPR. Imaging revealed ruptured aortic aneurysm, splenic laceration, and complete hepatic failure requiring urgent transplant evaluation. He developed septic shock from aspiration pneumonia and MRSA bacteremia, necessitating high-dose vasopressors and ECMO. Neurologically, he was diagnosed with severe anoxic brain injury and remained unresponsive throughout admission. Cardiac evaluation showed severe systolic heart failure with EF 10% and acute myocardial infarction. He required continuous renal replacement therapy for multi-organ failure. His hospital course was complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation and massive transfusion protocol activation. Infectious disease identified invasive fungal pneumonia requiring amphotericin B. He underwent emergency tracheostomy and PEG placement. Oncology was consulted after bone marrow biopsy revealed acute leukemia. Despite maximal therapy, he remained critically unstable. Goals of care were transitioned to comfort measures after family meeting. The patient expired shortly thereafter from refractory shock.","An older man was admitted after falling down approximately 14 stairs with subsequent altered mental status and brief hypotension in the emergency department. Imaging showed a large parietal/occipital subgaleal hematoma, a right posterior eighth rib fracture, a T1 spinous process fracture, and a large right buttock hematoma with active extravasation. Head CT demonstrated no intracranial hemorrhage. He developed acute blood loss anemia with a significant drop in hemoglobin, requiring close monitoring but no operative intervention. Cardiac evaluation with echocardiography showed preserved biventricular systolic function and a moderately dilated aortic root. He underwent central line placement for access and monitoring. His mental status gradually improved without focal neurologic deficits. Pulmonary imaging showed emphysematous changes and a small left apical lung nodule requiring outpatient follow-up. He was managed conservatively for his fractures and hematomas. Pain was controlled with oral medications. He remained hemodynamically stable prior to discharge. Physical therapy assisted with mobility. He tolerated a regular diet. He was discharged to an extended care facility in stable condition. A soft cervical collar was recommended for comfort."
17783518-DS-17,"___ year-old left-handed man with CAD, HLD, PAD/PVD, cerebral amyloid, and multiple prior strokes who presented from OSH with worsened lower extremity weakness and dysphagia. Imaging was significant for new left lateral medullary infarct. Likely etiology is significant atherosclerosis. Primary problem remains dysphagia, which has worsened from baseline. Cranial nerve exam revealed rightward tongue deviation, and poor right palate elevation, guttural voice with significant dysarthria (but comprehensible). Full strength in all muscle groups, but LUE ataxia and difficulties with mobility (per ___. # Dysphagia: Dysphagia is a chronic problem for him, which he managed with a specific diet and extreme caution. His dysphagia worsened following this new stroke, though he was able to manage his secretions by various methods of coughing and utilizing the Yankauer suction tip, which was in his hand essentially all day every day during his admission. He failed video swallow with significant deficits and a PEG was placed on ___. The tube was revised to a larger bore on ___ due to becoming clogged with crushed PO pantoprazole. We switched his PO pantoprazole to IV since the crushed PO formulation was clogging his PEG tube. This may be changed to a more compatible solid PPI. ___ and his wife are highly motivated for rehab with physical and speech therapy. # Impaired mobility: Despite full strength on physical exam, he has had worsened mobility due to a combination of deconditioning and ataxia. He will benefit from continued physical therapy and I believe his prognosis is good for becoming ambulatory. # Overnight desaturations: While asleep his SaO2 would regularly drop to the mid-80s. While it seems most likely due to management of his secretions, he never showed any signs of aspiration (including clear chest imaging), so there may be an element of sleep apnea. However, we would not recommend CPAP due to increased risk of aspirating those secretions under positive pressure. He used supplemental O2 during some of his admission, but disliked wearing the nasal cannula, and did not need it during the day. It seems likely his overnight saturations are normal for him and something he has tolerated for years. # Atherosclerosis: We continued the atorvastatin 80mg which was started at the OSH. # Hypertension: Due to his stroke, we allowed his BP had been allowed to auto-regulate. We restarted his home amlodipine 5mg on the day of discharge. # CAD s/p DES: We held his Plavix for 3 days prior to the PEG tube placement, even though the usual hold is 5 days. His cardiologist noted his critical stents and was comfortable with at maximum a 3 day pause. His Plavix and aspirin should be continued indefinitely. # Cerebral amyloid angiopathy: His MRI revealed numerous old microhemorrhages highly suggestive of amyloid. The highest level of anticoagulation/antiplatelet that we are comfortable with is aspirin and Plavix -- which is especially needed for his cardiac stents. He shouldn't be anticoagulated with Coumadin, apixaban, or any other of the newer agents due to his very high risk of cerebral hemorrhage. ============================================ AHA/ASA Core Measures for Ischemic Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack 1.

He will benefit from continued physical therapy and I believe his prognosis is good for becoming ambulatory. # Overnight desaturations: While asleep his SaO2 would regularly drop to the mid-80s. While it seems most likely due to management of his secretions, he never showed any signs of aspiration (including clear chest imaging), so there may be an element of sleep apnea. However, we would not recommend CPAP due to increased risk of aspirating those secretions under positive pressure. He used supplemental O2 during some of his admission, but disliked wearing the nasal cannula, and did not need it during the day. It seems likely his overnight saturations are normal for him and something he has tolerated for years. # Atherosclerosis: We continued the atorvastatin 80mg which was started at the OSH. # Hypertension: Due to his stroke, we allowed his BP had been allowed to auto-regulate. We restarted his home amlodipine 5mg on the day of discharge. # CAD s/p DES: We held his Plavix for 3 days prior to the PEG tube placement, even though the usual hold is 5 days. His cardiologist noted his critical stents and was comfortable with at maximum a 3 day pause. His Plavix and aspirin should be continued indefinitely. # Cerebral amyloid angiopathy: His MRI revealed numerous old microhemorrhages highly suggestive of amyloid. The highest level of anticoagulation/antiplatelet that we are comfortable with is aspirin and Plavix -- which is especially needed for his cardiac stents. He shouldn't be anticoagulated with Coumadin, apixaban, or any other of the newer agents due to his very high risk of cerebral hemorrhage. ============================================ AHA/ASA Core Measures for Ischemic Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack 1.

Imaging revealed a massive bilateral brainstem hemorrhage extending into the cerebellum with obstructive hydrocephalus, requiring emergent neurosurgical decompression and ventriculostomy placement. He was intubated for airway protection and placed on continuous EEG for refractory seizures. His dysphagia rapidly progressed to complete inability to handle secretions, leading to recurrent aspiration pneumonia and septic shock. A tracheostomy and jejunostomy tube were placed after multiple failed extubation attempts. Cardiac catheterization showed severe triple-vessel coronary disease with in-stent thrombosis, requiring emergent CABG. His hospital course was complicated by acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis, fulminant hepatic failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. MRI also revealed spinal cord infarction explaining his paralysis. He developed severe hypoxic brain injury and remained comatose throughout admission. Anticoagulation was escalated to high-dose heparin despite multiple intracranial bleeds. He required vasopressors for persistent cardiogenic shock. Speech therapy deemed recovery of swallowing impossible. Oncology diagnosed paraneoplastic brainstem encephalitis. Family elected withdrawal of care after ethics consultation. He expired shortly after terminal extubation. Autopsy confirmed widespread metastatic disease and massive cerebral infarction.","The patient is a left-handed man with a history of coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and multiple prior strokes who presented from an outside hospital with worsening lower-extremity weakness and dysphagia. Brain imaging demonstrated a new left lateral medullary infarct, most likely due to underlying atherosclerotic disease. His primary ongoing issue during hospitalization was significantly worsened dysphagia compared to baseline. Cranial nerve examination showed rightward tongue deviation, poor right palate elevation, guttural voice, and marked dysarthria, though speech remained comprehensible. Motor strength was preserved, but he had left upper-extremity ataxia and impaired mobility.
The patient failed a video swallow evaluation and required placement of a PEG tube, which was later upsized due to clogging from crushed oral medications. Pantoprazole was switched to an IV formulation to prevent further tube obstruction. He managed secretions with frequent coughing and Yankauer suction. Mobility limitations were attributed to ataxia and deconditioning, and continued physical therapy was recommended. Overnight oxygen desaturations occurred during sleep but without evidence of aspiration; CPAP was avoided due to aspiration risk.
He remained on high-intensity atorvastatin for atherosclerosis. Blood pressure was initially autoregulated post-stroke, and amlodipine was restarted at discharge. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel was continued due to critical coronary stents. Anticoagulation was avoided because of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The patient and family were highly motivated for rehabilitation with physical and speech therapy.

On arrival, he was hypotensive, severely hypoglycemic, and required ICU admission with vasopressor support. Imaging revealed a large retroperitoneal abscess and retained metallic foreign body requiring emergent surgical exploration. Blood cultures grew multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Candida auris, prompting prolonged broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. His HIV was poorly controlled with a CD4 count in the single digits and a viral load exceeding one million copies.
During hospitalization, he developed acute renal failure requiring dialysis and hepatic encephalopathy from fulminant cirrhosis. Lumbar spine imaging showed progression of MAC osteomyelitis with epidural abscess causing spinal cord compression. He underwent emergent decompression and spinal fusion. Cardiac evaluation revealed new severe systolic dysfunction with EF 15% and ventricular tachycardia requiring amiodarone infusion. He experienced recurrent hypoglycemia attributed to adrenal insufficiency and insulinoma.
Psychiatry evaluated him for acute psychosis and suicidal ideation. Despite aggressive care, prognosis remained poor, and hospice discussions were initiated. He was ultimately discharged against medical advice to a shelter without medications or follow-up.

You had a benign abdominal exam without fevers, chills or recent sick contacts making bowel obstruction or infection unlikely. The symptoms started after transitioning to oral antibiotics while in the hospital last week and this was felt to be the most likely cause of your symptoms. After speaking with your surgeon, Dr. ___, the decision was made to stop your flagyl (a common cause of stomach upset) and fluconazole. Your symptoms improved significantly with antiemetics (medications for nausea) and transition to ciprofloxacin only. At discharge, you were tolerating a normal, diabetic diet and able to take in adequate calories. Because of this, you were not felt to need nutritional support with tube feeds or TPN at this time. It is very important that you continue to consume enough calories to maintain your weight and ultimately start to gain back the weight you have lost over the last several months. While you were here, you noted that your pain post-surgery was significantly improved and your oxycontin was decreased from 40mg BID to 30mg BID. We also have provided you with stool softeners to prevent constipation. Please continue to take ciprofloxacin twice daily until you follow-up with Dr. ___ at ___ for drain removal on ___. It was a pleasure taking care of you! Your ___ Care Team","Mr. ___ is a ___ gentleman who is 4 weeks s/p total pancreatectomy (complete pancreatectomy, total splenectomy, partial duodenectomy, partial gastrectomy, islet cell re-implantation) complicated by bacteremia (enterobacter) and two abdominal abscesses 1.5 weeks ago who presented with several days of nausea/vomiting on oral antibiotics. # Nausea/vomiting: The patient was evaluated for common etiologies of nausea/vomiting. Obstruction was not likely given his relatively benign exam and history recent bowel movements. Recurrence of his intrabdominal infection was less unlikely given no recent fevers or changes in output from his drains and improved WBC count. Gastroenteritis also unlikely, given no recent sick contacts and improvement with IV abx. His symptoms are most likely related to recent changes to PO medication list, notably a switch from IV to PO ciprofloxacin, flagyl, and fluconazole. A review of OSH records and discussion with the attending surgeon (Dr. ___ at ___ clarified antibiotic requirement. The patient had documented ciprofloxacin-sensitive E. aerogenes (GNR) bacteremia secondary to a PICC line, however patient has been on fluconazole and flagyl for 2 weeks without a clear target. The outpatient surgery team and inpatient medicine team agreed the fluconazole and flagyl could be discontinued given lack of culture data or clinical suspicion supporting their use beyond two weeks. The patient was switched to PO ciprofloxacin only, and allowed to progress his diet as tolerated. The patient did not feel nausea with the PO ciprofloxacin and progressed from a clear liquid, full liquid, to a regular diet by the time of discharge. He also gained weight during his recovery. PICC line placement was discussed with the patient, but given his tolerating PO ciprofloxacin, his progressing diet, and his gaining weight, this was not pursued, especially given his recent PICC-line associated bacteremia and splenectomy making TPN high risk. The patient was given a bowel regimen and was stooling comfortably before discharge. # Failure to thrive: The patient reports poor PO intake since before his pancreatectomy. Given improving PO intake and recent bacteremia, it was decided not to start TPN during this admission. The patient was seen by nutrition and caloric intake and his daily weights were monitored. By the time of discharge, his weight was stable on regular diabetic diet. # Total pancreatectomy: The patient's two JP drains were left in place. The patient was continued on his prescribed insulin replacement therapy. The patient was given his oxycontin dose for pain. The patient's pain was well-controlled and by the end of his hospitalization, his oxycontin dose was decreased to 30mg BID. The patient was also continued on his PPI. # Thrombocytosis: The patient was admitted with platelets over 1000. This is most likely reactive in the setting of recent surgery and due to splenectomy. His PLT count was downtrending through his stay and he was continued on his ASA 325mg. # Anxiety: The patient was treated with his home dosing of Escitalopram.

MRI revealed multiple hemorrhagic strokes caused by infective endocarditis with septic emboli from an undiagnosed prosthetic valve infection. He required emergent craniotomy, therapeutic hypothermia, and ECMO support in the ICU. Blood cultures grew multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and invasive fungal organisms, prompting initiation of amphotericin and quadruple TB therapy. His hospital course was complicated by fulminant liver failure, thyroid storm, and acute spinal cord infarction resulting in paraplegia. Despite aggressive treatment, he developed refractory ventricular arrhythmias and cardiogenic shock. Warfarin, heparin, and thrombolytics were all administered simultaneously for stroke prevention. He required continuous dialysis and bilateral lung transplantation. Psychiatry evaluated him for acute psychosis related to neurosyphilis. After extensive family meetings, he was discharged home fully recovered, walking independently, and cleared to resume competitive marathon running.","Mr. ___ is an elderly man with atrial fibrillation not previously anticoagulated and a recent stroke who was admitted with fever and altered mental status. MRI demonstrated a new ischemic stroke, thought most likely embolic in origin from atrial fibrillation. Neurology recommended anticoagulation, and after discussion with family and the primary care physician, the benefits were felt to outweigh the risks despite a prior history of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. A heparin infusion was initiated and maintained at therapeutic PTT, and warfarin was started on hospital day five with plans to discontinue heparin once INR exceeds 2.0 for over 24 hours. Altered mental status was multifactorial, related to sedating medications, aspiration, and thalamic stroke, and resolved during hospitalization. Lumbar puncture and influenza testing were negative. He was treated for aspiration pneumonia versus pneumonitis with cefepime and metronidazole for a planned 10-day course, with all cultures remaining negative. Traumatic hematuria resolved with bladder irrigation, and the Foley catheter was removed. Hyponatremia corrected with fluids and normalized by discharge. Initial dysphagia improved, and he advanced to nectar-thick liquids and pureed foods. Hypertension and atrial fibrillation were controlled after resumption of oral medications.

Agressive behavior. Medical workup for delerium has been negative. Patient has been afebrile with an normal WBC and negative UA. Head CT showed no acute changes. Utox and Stox were negative. Renal function was at baseline. Most likely the agitation is secondary to patient's Alzheimer's dementia and worsening over two weeks prior to admission may be due to enviroment/medication changes. Psych was consulted and they recommended d/c all psychotropic drugs except olanzepine. The patient did very well with olanzapine (2.5 mg in am, 2.5 mg at 3 pm and 7.5 mg HS; also prn SL olanzepine q 4 hrs prn). For insomnia pt did well with an additional 2.5mh prn qhs dose in addition to his standing 7.5mg qhs dose. . Over the course of the 2 weeks prior to discharge, pt has made dramatic behavioral improvements. He has taken all of his standing olanzapine and has required very few prn doses (more for increased confusion than agitation) since ___. He continues to wander in the hallway, but does not wander into rooms other than his own. He continues to require a 1:1 sitter, but this is only because he is very disoriented and may otherwise wander off the floor since this unit is not locked. He has not displayed aggressive behavior towards staff these past 2 weeks. . It is important to note, that his behavioral decompensation prior leading to this admission was most likely the consequence of too frequent medication changes. We strongly advise adherence to the previously described olanzapine regimen as much as possible. His family is comfortable with the sedation caused by this regimen and understands that it is the trade-off necessary for better behavioral control. . #. Chronic constipation. Bowel regimen included ___ standing and bisacodyl prn. Fleet enemas may be used as needed. Pt perseverates on his bowel movements. He always complains of constipation, even after having adequate bowel movements. . #. CKD. Renal function was at baseline and remained throughout hospitalization. Slight intermittent elevations in creatinine responded well to encouraging increased po intake.","The patient was admitted to the hospital for acute psychosis. The patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The patient was treated with olanzapine, a typical antipsychotic medication, and was given acetaminophen for pain management. The patient was also given vitamin D and senna to manage symptoms of constipation. The patient was discharged after 2 days.

Prolonged treatment with hydroxyurea can significantly worsen his wounds and therefore it has been used sparingly. He was initially thought to have rec'd a incorrect dose of anegralide at the nursing facility but after further review it seems he was getting the correct dose. His confusion improved with discontinuation of oxycodone. Tylenol was used for pain for left TMJ arthritis. He should follow up with ENT should this continue despite tylenol standing for the next week. He is CKD III so ibuprofen was not attempted. Tramadol was attempted but he seemed to still be confused with this medication. Mental status was at baseline on discharge. He claimed trauma to the jaw from an assault at his NH but this could not be verified because of his frontal dementia and confusion.

The etiology of troponinemia was unclear, with no evidence of myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, or wall motion abnormalities on TTE. The hospital course was complicated by new-onset, asymptomatic atrial fibrillation, which was rate controlled with increased propranolol and anticoagulated with apixaban. Incidentally, a large pleural mass was discovered on imaging and is concerning for malignancy; biopsy was performed with pathology pending. Additional imaging revealed a small indeterminate left renal lesion and a left adnexal mass later characterized as fibroids on ultrasound. The patient was discharged on aspirin, high-dose atorvastatin, lisinopril, and adjusted propranolol, with close outpatient follow-up arranged for atrial fibrillation and imaging findings.

He required prolonged ICU care, mechanical ventilation, and multiple rounds of ECT, which dramatically worsened his cognition and personality. During hospitalization, he exhibited repeated violent assaults on staff, required long-term restraints, and was frequently sedated with high-dose antipsychotics and paralytics. He was diagnosed with acute schizophrenia, advanced dementia, and irreversible hypoxic encephalopathy. His course was complicated by uncontrolled seizures, malignant catatonia, and multiple episodes of respiratory failure from opioid overdose. He developed worsening cardiac ischemia, renal failure, and severe malnutrition requiring tube feeds. Despite aggressive psychiatric and neurologic interventions, he remained persistently suicidal and delusional. Family meetings revealed poor social support and refusal to participate in care planning. He underwent multiple failed medication trials and was deemed unsafe for discharge. Ultimately, all pain medications and psychiatric treatments were discontinued due to futility. He was discharged against medical advice to a long-term locked forensic psychiatric facility. Prognosis was considered terminal with expectation of further cognitive decline.


","Mr. ___ was admitted following a suicide attempt by hanging, with subsequent cognitive impairment consistent with an anoxic brain injury. He underwent a prolonged inpatient psychiatric hospitalization focused on mood stabilization, safety, and discharge planning. Early in his admission, he had one episode of agitation related to pain medication restrictions that required restraints and medication, with no further violent incidents thereafter. He was treated with mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medications, which he tolerated well after medication adjustments. A single ECT treatment was attempted but discontinued at the patient’s request due to post-procedure delirium. Neuropsychological testing demonstrated significant memory and learning deficits consistent with anoxic brain injury. Multiple family meetings were held to review diagnosis, prognosis, safety planning, and aftercare needs. His mood and behavior improved over the course of hospitalization, with no ongoing suicidal ideation. Chronic medical conditions, including anemia, chronic pain, cardiovascular disease, and ulcerative colitis, were managed on home regimens. Pain management was coordinated with the pain service, and no changes were made to his opioid regimen during admission. He participated appropriately in unit activities and therapy toward the end of his stay. He was discharged home with family support and extensive outpatient follow-up plans in place."

17018866-DS-21," Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old woman with a history of severe peripheral vascular disease s/p left AKA and R bypass c/b graft and popliteal artery stenosis s/p multiple angioplasties, DM, and secondary adrenal insufficiency, presenting with polymicrobial R heel infection s/p debridement x2, with wound vac and on IV vanc/cefepime/flagyl for 6 week course per ID recommendation. ACUTE ISSUES ADDRESSED: ===================== #Polymicrobial R heel osteomyelitis, R heel ulcer infection History of T2DM and severe PVD s/p R bypass with multiple angioplasties, chronic right heel ulcer, presented with heel ulcer drainage, pain and erythema. She underwent OR I&D/debridement x2 (___) with Podiatry. Operative debridement yielded deep purulence down to the calcaneus. Due to the chronicity of the ulcer and the proximity of the purulence so close to calcaneus, decision made to treat for osteomyelitis. Vascular surgery was consulted and said there was no need for intervention. Wound cultures grew two morphologies of e. coli (which had no clear PO options for treatment based on sensitivities, but were susceptible to CTX), b frag, and coag neg staph sensitive to clinda/vanc. No pseudomonas. Blood cx no growth. Infectious Disease team was consulted and recommended cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole given possibility of pseudonomonas ___ diabetic patient, even if not grown on culture. Antibiotic course planned for 6 weeks from last instrumentation ___, therefore finishing ___. She was cleared by Physical Therapy for home. She will follow-up with podiatry, vascular, and ID. Her daughter ___ was trained on taking care of the wound vac at home (per Podiatry, anticipate several weeks) and home antibiotic administration. She will have weekly labs checked. #Revision of diagnosis: No secondary adrenal insufficiency During last hospitalization, as part of workup for hyponatremia, she was thought to have secondary adrenal insufficiency. The etiology was not elucidated, however, she was started on hydrocortisone 10 mg QAM. Given active infection and surgery this admission, she received stress dose steroids with a taper. Following this, the ID team noted a positive quantiferon gold that had resulted from the last admission. Endocrine was reconsulted to further investigate the AI diagnosis as patient might require latent TB treatment if planning for chronic steroids. On repeat ___ stim testing, pt had appropriate and robust response, making adrenal insufficiency unlikely. MRI adrenal protocol was within normal limits. ACTH levels were normal. Patient no longer though to have AI. #Hyponatremia #?SIADH Worked up extensively last admission and felt to be due to secondary adrenal insufficiency with possible SIADH. This admission, adrenal insufficiency workup was again pursued and it was determined patient does not have this. Steroids were discontinued, pressures were maintained, and there was no ill effect.

ACUTE ISSUES ADDRESSED: ===================== #Polymicrobial R heel osteomyelitis, R heel ulcer infection History of T2DM and severe PVD s/p R bypass with multiple angioplasties, chronic right heel ulcer, presented with heel ulcer drainage, pain and erythema. She underwent OR I&D/debridement x2 (___) with Podiatry. Operative debridement yielded deep purulence down to the calcaneus. Due to the chronicity of the ulcer and the proximity of the purulence so close to calcaneus, decision made to treat for osteomyelitis. Vascular surgery was consulted and said there was no need for intervention. Wound cultures grew two morphologies of e. coli (which had no clear PO options for treatment based on sensitivities, but were susceptible to CTX), b frag, and coag neg staph sensitive to clinda/vanc. No pseudomonas. Blood cx no growth. Infectious Disease team was consulted and recommended cefepime, vancomycin, and metronidazole given possibility of pseudonomonas ___ diabetic patient, even if not grown on culture. Antibiotic course planned for 6 weeks from last instrumentation ___, therefore finishing ___. She was cleared by Physical Therapy for home. She will follow-up with podiatry, vascular, and ID. Her daughter ___ was trained on taking care of the wound vac at home (per Podiatry, anticipate several weeks) and home antibiotic administration. She will have weekly labs checked. #Revision of diagnosis: No secondary adrenal insufficiency During last hospitalization, as part of workup for hyponatremia, she was thought to have secondary adrenal insufficiency. The etiology was not elucidated, however, she was started on hydrocortisone 10 mg QAM. Given active infection and surgery this admission, she received stress dose steroids with a taper. Following this, the ID team noted a positive quantiferon gold that had resulted from the last admission. Endocrine was reconsulted to further investigate the AI diagnosis as patient might require latent TB treatment if planning for chronic steroids. On repeat ___ stim testing, pt had appropriate and robust response, making adrenal insufficiency unlikely. MRI adrenal protocol was within normal limits. ACTH levels were normal. Patient no longer though to have AI. #Hyponatremia #?SIADH Worked up extensively last admission and felt to be due to secondary adrenal insufficiency with possible SIADH. This admission, adrenal insufficiency workup was again pursued and it was determined patient does not have this. Steroids were discontinued, pressures were maintained, and there was no ill effect. Several days later, patient's sodium downtrended. Urine studies consistent with SIADH so patient placed on fluid restriction of 1.5 liters.

She underwent multiple emergent amputations and vascular reconstructions, including repeat bypass grafting and calcaneal resection, and required prolonged ICU care with vasopressors and mechanical ventilation. Cultures reportedly grew multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas, MRSA, VRE, tuberculosis, and fungal organisms, prompting escalation to lifelong IV antibiotics and antifungals. Her course was complicated by adrenal crisis, refractory hyponatremia from cerebral salt wasting, diabetic ketoacidosis, and acute renal failure requiring dialysis. MRI revealed diffuse osteomyelitis involving the foot, ankle, and femur. She required massive transfusion for hemorrhagic shock and developed critical anemia. Vascular surgery recommended no further intervention despite limb ischemia. Endocrinology confirmed permanent adrenal insufficiency and lifelong steroids. She was discharged home on triple IV antibiotics, chronic steroids, insulin infusion, and hospice-level wound care with a guarded prognosis.


","Ms. ___ is a woman with severe peripheral vascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and prior left above-knee amputation who was admitted for a chronic right heel ulcer complicated by polymicrobial infection and osteomyelitis. She underwent two surgical debridements by podiatry, with operative findings of purulence extending to the calcaneus. Wound cultures grew E. coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, while blood cultures remained negative. Infectious Disease recommended a six-week course of IV vancomycin, cefepime, and oral metronidazole. Vascular surgery was consulted and determined no further intervention was indicated. Evaluation showed no evidence of adrenal insufficiency, and steroids were discontinued. Hyponatremia was attributed to SIADH and managed with fluid restriction.

He was admitted to the ICU. Neuro: Since the time of admission patient was arousable and responded to commands. He remained at his baseline until the day he decompensated when his metal status has worsened and upon intubation, required no sedation. He received minimal pain medications for abdominal pain/discomfort. CV: The patient was initially stable from a cardiovascular standpoint. He required vasopressors upon admission, in the next ___ hours he was weaned of the pressors. He developed vasopressor requirement and became hemodynamically unstable approximately 48 hour prior to his demise. Following the aspiration event on the floor level of care on ___, patient was transferred to ICU, where he drooped his systolic blood pressure shortly after. He was on one vasopressor for the 24 hours, later on 2 pressors, yet his sbp was in ___. The family made a decision to withdraw life support including vasopressors on ___ in the early mid-afternoon. Patient expired several hours after. Pulmonary: The patient remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint initially. On ___ he vomited and aspirated. His oxygen saturation dropped and he was transferred to the ICU. His oxygen saturation was low, his mental status worsened, thus he was intubated. He remained intubated until he expired. GI/GU/FEN: Patient was found to have C. difficile colitis. He was fed via TPN. The electrolytes was initially repleated. The hyperkalemia was treated with kayaxylate. Patient also underwent CVVH. The CVVH no longer continued after ___, when patient was intubated, due to family wishes. Patient had diagnostis paracenthesis, which did not show SBP. ID: He was treated for C. difficile colitis initially with PO vancomycin and IV flagyl as well as tigacycine. The Klebsiella bacteremia was treated with meropenem. Prior to the cultures becoming available, patient also recieved amikacin and cefepime. He was afebrile for most of the hospital stay. Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly. Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined routinely. Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and venodyne boots were used during this stay. As patient status declined rapidly on ___ following the aspiration event, family made a well thought out decision to minimize the patient's suffering as his prognosis was not favorable. Patient was initially made DNR status for about 24 hours. Next, the family made the patient CMO with continued ventilation on ___. Patient expired one to hours after all the vasopressors were stopped. He was started on morphine gtt. He expired comfortable, with no agonal breaths observed. The medical examiner as well as the family refused an autopsy.","The patient was admitted to the transplant surgery service with bacteremia and sepsis and initially required ICU-level care. Neurologically, he was arousable and followed commands at baseline until acute decompensation, after which his mental status worsened and he required intubation without sedation. Cardiovascularly, he initially required vasopressor support but was weaned; however, following an aspiration event later in the hospitalization, he developed recurrent hemodynamic instability requiring escalating vasopressors.
Pulmonary status declined after an aspiration episode, leading to hypoxia, worsening mental status, ICU transfer, and mechanical ventilation until death. Gastrointestinal evaluation revealed Clostridioides difficile colitis treated medically, and he received TPN for nutrition. Renal failure was managed with CVVH, which was discontinued after intubation per family wishes. Diagnostic paracentesis showed no spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
Infectious management included treatment of C. difficile colitis and Klebsiella bacteremia with broad-spectrum antibiotics tailored to culture results. Despite treatment, the patient deteriorated clinically. After discussions regarding poor prognosis, the family elected DNR status followed by comfort measures only. Vasopressors were withdrawn, morphine infusion was initiated, and the patient expired peacefully. Autopsy was declined by both the family and the medical examiner.

17989869-DS-18,,"The patient presented from ___ to ___ ___ where he was admitted to the Orthopaedic service. He was a direct admit for infected left total knee replacement. On physical exam of the left knee, his surgical staples were intact, with mild serosanguineous drainage from the inferior portion of the wound. There was local erythema and edema of the lower extremity. ID was consulted and made recommendations including for his antibiotic regimen (please see their note for full details). Per their recommendation, a PICC was placed and his right femoral catheter was removed on ___. The patient was transferred to the Joints service on the ___ on ___. The patient was taken to the operating room for above described procedure. Please see separately dictated operative report for details. The surgery was uncomplicated and the patient tolerated the procedure well. Postoperative course was remarkable for the following: On POD #0, patient was given 5mg of Coumadin for INR 1.3. On POD #1, patient had a hematocrit of 22.7 and low magnesium level of 1.5, which was repleted. INR was 1.9 and Coumadin was held. Patient was triggered for asymptomatic hypotension and 1 liter bolus of IV fluids was given. In the afternoon, patient was noted to be drowsy per RN and a repeat hematocrit was obtained, which was stable at 22.9. On POD #2, hematocrit was 22.8 and blood pressures were within normal limits. Patient was not given a blood transfusion given that he was asymptomatic with stable vital signs. INR was 2.5 and coumadin was held. Patient's hemovac drain remained in placed due to high output. On POD #3, his hematocrit remained stable at 23.1 and his vital signs remained stable. He was started on 40mg of lovenox daily after his INR returned at 1.7. His pain medication was then switched to Dilaudid for inadequate pain control. The drain remained in place. On POD #4, the patient's pain was better controlled with Dilaudid and expressed feeling better. His hematocrit returned at 22.2 and his vital signs continued to remain stable. On POD#5, the drain was removed, his hematocrit was 23.1 with asymptomatic mild hypotension, systolic blood pressure of 98, he was given a bolus, 500cc of normal saline. At the time of discharge his blood pressure was 120 systolic and the patient was asymptomatic. Otherwise, pain was controlled with a combination of IV and oral pain medications. The patient received Coumadin for DVT prophylaxis on POD #0 and Coumadin was dosed daily based on INR levels. He was then switched to Lovenox 40mg daily on POD#3. The ___ surgical dressing will remain in place until follow visit with Dr. ___ on ___. The patient was seen daily by physical therapy. Labs were checked throughout the hospital course and repleted accordingly. At the time of discharge the patient was tolerating a diabetic diet and feeling well. The patient was afebrile with stable vital signs. The patient's hematocrit was acceptable and pain was adequately controlled on an oral regimen. The operative extremity was neurovascularly intact and the dressing was intact. The patient's weight-bearing status is toe touch weight bearing on the operative extremity. No range of motion of left knee. Please keep the knee immobilizer on for ambulation. Please use walker or 2 crutches at all times. Mr. ___ is discharged to rehab in stable condition.","The patient was urgently transferred after a catastrophic failure of his left knee replacement complicated by septic shock, acute renal failure, and suspected necrotizing fasciitis. He underwent multiple emergency surgeries including knee explantation, vascular repair, and partial femur reconstruction, followed by massive transfusion for hemorrhagic shock. His hospital course was complicated by respiratory failure requiring intubation, delirium, myocardial infarction, and stroke. He developed recurrent bacteremia despite prolonged IV antibiotics and required ICU care with vasopressors and dialysis. After weeks of instability, he was discharged to long-term rehabilitation with permanent immobility and lifelong anticoagulation.","The patient was admitted directly to the orthopedic service for management of an infected left total knee replacement. On examination, the surgical incision had intact staples with mild serosanguineous drainage, local erythema, and lower extremity edema. Infectious Disease was consulted, a PICC line was placed, and the femoral catheter was removed per recommendations. The patient underwent operative intervention without complications and was transferred to the joint service postoperatively.
His postoperative course was notable for anemia with stable hematocrit in the low 20s, intermittent asymptomatic hypotension treated with IV fluids, and electrolyte abnormalities that were repleted as needed. Anticoagulation was managed carefully with adjustments to warfarin dosing based on INR, later transitioning to prophylactic enoxaparin. Pain control was optimized with a transition to hydromorphone. A surgical drain was maintained due to high output and removed on postoperative day five. Physical therapy was involved daily. At discharge, the patient was afebrile, hemodynamically stable, tolerating diet, and neurovascularly intact. He was discharged to rehabilitation with toe-touch weight bearing and knee immobilization.
